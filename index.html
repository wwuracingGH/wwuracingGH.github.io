We compete in the Formula SAE West competition in Southern CA with our finished car every summer.
The competition involves both business and engineering tests and critiques that puts our work to the test, furthering our knowledge for
the next car and life after graduation. The car's performance is tested through Acceleration, Skid Pad, Autocross and Endurance events.
The business events (Design, Sales and Cost) judge the process behind the physical design of the car, theoretical production cost, and a
marketing and distribution plan for a consumer version of the car.
